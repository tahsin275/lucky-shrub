                    together to transform your outdoor spaces. Started by a
                    husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, Lucky Shrub has been
                    providing garden design, maintenance, and landscaping
                    services for over 15 years. Our passion for plants and
                    nature drives us to create stunning and sustainable outdoor
                    spaces for our clients.

                    Jason, our garden architect, has 18 years of experience in
                    creating unique garden designs. He leads our team of skilled
                    landscapers to bring each design to life. Maria, our
                    marketing manager, oversees the nursery and is dedicated to
